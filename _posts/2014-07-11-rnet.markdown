description: "RNet is a realistic random network generator. It generates a social network from some statistical parameters. It deliberately assign a community to each node to achieve realistic social behavior.

Also, it is highly flexible, it can accept several parameters. Besides the size of the generated network, it also accepts: outdegree, indegree and community size probability distributions, probability of connecting inside a node community and probability of connecting a node to a totally random node. These parameters make possible to generate a large variety of networks with much smaller restrictions than other generators.

RNet is also very fast, it is possible to generate graphs with millions of vertices in matter of seconds! It uses multithreading to better explore modern CPU power."
