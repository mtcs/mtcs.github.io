Faster being multi-platform is not our main concern. We will focus on Linux servers, Ubuntu LTS in particular. Though it doesn't mean that it cannot work on other platforms. Notice that Faster uses OpenMP and advanced C++11 features in its core, therefore it needs a modern compiler that support those functions like GCC. You are welcome to try using it on other platforms. Let us know if you find out anything interesting.
