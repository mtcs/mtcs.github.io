Our API documentation just got an Update! We are using Doxygen to generate doc more easily. We wave
focused on classes that the user needs to consult in order to use the framework.
We also provide a PDF version of the API reference guide for offline consultation.

Our Docs can be found at the __Latest__ release doc links at our [documentation
page](/faster/doc.html).
