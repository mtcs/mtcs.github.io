[0.0.1] is a Alpha Here!

It is possible to create a FDD Datasets from the memory and from file using the __fdd__ and __indexedFdd__ class constructors.

We have __char__, __int__, __long int__, __float__, __double__, __vector__  and __string__ Datasets working with __Map__, __BulkMap__, __FlatMap__, __BulkFlatMap__, __reduce__ and __BulkReduce__.

Collect function now can get the dataset data.

A test routine is also being implemented to help with homologation and guarantee wramework's correctness.

[Documantation Here] or at least it will be...

Enjoy!
