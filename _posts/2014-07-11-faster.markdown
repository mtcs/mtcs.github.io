A low latency distributed computing framework for processing large scale Data. [Faster] was inspired on Apache [Spark], a state of the art Big Data processing framework. Although, Spark was designed for a specific context where, input data is so large that framework overheads are acceptable. Faster implements most Spark's operators in C++ focusing on low latency and low overhead. Also, Faster implements specialized operators for exploring data locality. With these operators, Faster can achieve a __30x speedup over Spark__ running PageRank on a graph with one billion edges.

Faster is implemented in C++, uses OpenMP for thread paralelism and MPI for process communication and job execution. Therefor it is perfectly compatible fith High Performance Computing clusters, supercomputers and grid engines.
